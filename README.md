Sublime Text tmLanguage file for helping surveyors / civil engineers more clearly read .fbk and .csv files

Install: 

Copy the csv.sublime-settings,	csv.tmLanguage, fieldbook.sublime-settings and fieldbook.tmLanguage files to your Sublime Text plugin folder:

C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User\

Now every time you open an .csv or .fbk in Sublime Text the context highlighting will show.

Recommended for the "Monokai" color scheme.

This file's context highlighting is based off of the Civil 3D field codes located in c3d_coding.txt in this repo (you don't need this file to run the tmLanguage files, its only here for reference).
