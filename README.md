Sublime Text tmLanguage file for helping surveyors / civil engineers more clearly read .fbk and .csv files

Install: Copy the files to your Sublime Text plugin folder:

Now every time you open an .csv or .fbk in Sublime Text the context highlighting will show.

Recommended for the "Monokai" color scheme.
